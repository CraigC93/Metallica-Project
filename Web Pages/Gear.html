    <h2>James Hetfield - Lead Vocals / Rhtyhm Guitarist</h2>

    <h3 >1969 Gibson SG Standard</h3>
    <img src="https://49731-537946-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Gibson-SG-Standard.jpg" alt="Gibson" height="200" width="65">
  
<p class="guitar">    James bought this guitar from a friend from high school who played with him in the school’s jazz band. His mother helped him out with the payment, which was around $200.<br>
<br>  James used this guitar to write some of his first songs, and while in playing couple of high school bands. What happened to it after Metallica was formed is unfortunately unknown, since James started using a white Flying V by that time. 
If still in his possession, this guitar certainly holds a great sentimental value since James mother died just year later after buying him this guitar.<br>
</p>

<h3>Electra-Flying-V</h3>
<img src="https://49731-537946-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Electra-Flying-V.jpg" alt="FlyingV"height="200" width="65">
<p class="guitar">After the neck snapped on his Electra Flying V in 1984, James started using couple of different guitars. What soon came to be his main one was a white 1984 Gibson Explorer decorated with a sticker on it reading “So What”.<br><br>
  This guitar was originally equipped with Gibson Dirty Fingers pickups (496R/500T ), but sometime in the late 80s – presumably around 1987 when Kirk Hammett switched to EMGs as well – James took the pickups out and replaced them with the EMG 81/60 set.
  
<br><br>  Knowing that, and the fact that this was James’ favorite guitar at the time, the album Ride the Lightning (1984) was largely recorded using this particular guitar equipped with the stock Gibson pickups. EMGs didn’t come into play until the EP: Garage Days Re-revisited (1987) and …And Justice for All (1988).
  
  Just like his Electra Flying V, James restored his white Explorer and played it on “Death Magnetic” in 2008.</p>

  <h3>1984 Gibson Explorer “More Beer” </h3>
<img src="https://49731-537946-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Hetfield-More-Beer-Gibson-Explorer.jpg" alt="More Beer" height="200" width="65">
<p class="guitar">
  This guitar is essentially a twin sister to the previously mentioned Gibson Explorer. James used it as a backup guitar from around 1984 to 1988.<br>
Although almost identical to the “So What” Explorer, this one featured different stickers on it – making it easier to separate the two. <br><br>
The second Explorer had the words 1984 Gibson Explorer “So What” written on it in 1985. Sometime in 1986 James put a tape over the original writing, and wrote the words “More Beer” on it instead. After signing the deal with ESP in 1988, James added a Jagermeister sticker over the original Gibson logo on the headstock, and added another larger Jagermeister sticker just behind the bridge.

            <img src="https://mixdownmag.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Lars-Main.jpg" alt="Tama" height="200" width=500">
  
            <p class="guitar">   In what can be termed the band’s ‘pre-professional’ days of 1981-1983, Ulrich used a Ludwig kit with Yamaha stands and pedals during their live shows.<br><br>
               Some of this setup may have been used during the recording of Metallica’s first album, 1983’s Kill Em All, around which time the drummer received an endorsement from the Japanese manufacturer Tama, which still stands to this day.<br><br>
              Ulrich subsequently switched to a Tama Imperialstar kit for the tours surrounding Kill Em All. This kit had mahogany shells and six toms of various sizes.<br><br>
            </p>
            <h3>LARS ULRICH SIGNATURE KIT</h3>

            <p class="guitar">   By this stage Metallica had become so big, and Ulrich was so frequently photographed behind Tama kits that he became the first artist for whom the company designed a signature kit. <br><br>This Tama Granstar II kit and setup was used from the tours for Master of Puppets and into the 1990s and Metallica era.<br><br> For a while Tama even sold the entire kit as a complete set so that those at home could emulate Ulrich’s sound, and hopefully grimaces, at home.<br><br>The signature kit was comprised of; a 14×6.5” bell brass snare, which was changed at the end of the 80s for an 14×8” snare; two 24×16” kick drums; four rack toms ranging from 10×10” to 16×15”; as well as two floor 18×16” floor toms.<br>

<p class="guitar"> Kirk used this Gibson Flying V as his main guitar in Exodus, and on Metallica’s first couple of albums. The guitar was completely stock until 1987 when pickups were replaced with EMGs, and Kirk installed the Leo Quan BadAss bridge.<br><br> Many of Metallica’s great hits were recorded on this guitar, including “Fade to Black” (Kirk used only neck pickup for this one).<br>

<h3>ESP KH2 M-II “The Mummy”</h3>

<p class="guitar">This is noted as Kirk’s favorite guitar. It’s a Kirk Hammett signature model made by ESP and based on the M-II. He got it in 1996, just prior to recording the “Load” album.<br><br>
  The guitar has neck-thru-body design, and is fitted with EMG-81 (bridge) and EMG-60 (neck) humbucker set and it has 2 volume and 1 tone control.
  
  <br>The body paint is based upon poster for the movie “The Mummy” starring Boris Karloff, graphic of which Hammett actually owns the rights to.</p>

<p class="guitar">
  This guitar was also based on the M-II series. It is fitted with EMG-81/60 humbuckers, and the original Floyd Rose bridge.<br><br>
The body is painted black, with the custom graphic design. The guitar is named “Ouija” after a board used by supernatural believers to recieve messages from the spirits.<br><br> The board design seen on the picture bellow is painted on the guitar’s body.
